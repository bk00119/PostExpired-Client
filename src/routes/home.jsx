            <h2>Our Mission and Values</h2>
            <p>Food waste is a huge contributor to climate change accounting for 
                90% of global CO2 emissions. Our mission here at freeload is to reduce 
                food waste to nearly 0% by the end of 2030. 
            </p>

            <h2>Food Waste</h2>
            <p> Did you know expired food products are actually not 'expired'. Depending 
                on the product, food products tend to last way longer their projected expiration 
                date. Businesses tend to throw away these expired goods despite this resulting
                in our current global food waste crisis
            </p>
            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>With the help of over 100+ food businesses across the United States, we have established a 
                database of expired food products in your area that updates in realtime by the second!
